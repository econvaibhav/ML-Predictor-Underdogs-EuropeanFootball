# Predicting Underdog Victories Using ML for European Football Data

## Context

The 'Machine Learning for Social Scientists' project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze European football data spanning from 2008 to 2016. Our primary goal is to identify the attributes that lead to the victory of teams with unfavorable odds in European football games.

## Dataset

The dataset includes comprehensive information on European football, such as:
- Match results
- Player and team attributes
- Betting odds from up to 10 providers
- Detailed match events
The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer/data).

## Methodology

To address our research question, we have outlined the following methodology:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct an initial EDA to identify possible groups and factors influencing match outcomes.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:**
   - Narrow down the most significant influencing factors to 3-5 groups.

3. **Multiple Logistic Regressions:**
   - Analyze how different factors impact the odds ratio and outcomes.

4. **Machine Learning Approach:**
   - Initially employ supervised learning techniques, such as random forests, for intensive analysis.
   - Expand to unsupervised learning approaches as needed.

5. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Consider incorporating a predictive model to forecast star performers or match winners, while focusing primarily on grouping, interpretation, and visualization.
